3.  ### Other bonuses to take advantage of in Quotex

    **1). Risk-free trades:** this is a special kind of bonus offered to
    active traders to use in their daily trading. As the name suggests,
    Quotex risk-free trades are trades that remove all the risks from
    trading.

    For example, a trader who activates risk-free trades when trading
    gets back all his money equal to the risk-free trade amount when
    they lose a trade.

    Real-life scenario: if you have a risk-free bonus of, say, \$3 and
    you open a losing trade, Quotex will give you back all your money
    (\$3) from that trade.

    **2). Cashback:** This kind of bonus is more or less the same as the
    risk-free trades bonus but with a twist. Unlike risk-free trades
    that give you back all your lost money, cashback allows you to only
    receive a percentage of your trading volume back. **3). Cancel X
    points:** This is a tool used on Quotex to cancel a losing trade. If
    you use this tool you will salvage your money if your trade is
    losing. **4). Percentage of turnover:** This promo bonus allows you
    to get a percentage of your trading volume back when you trade.
